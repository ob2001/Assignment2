FindWords is a program that searches text files and outputs a list of all words longer than 5 characters in the order of occurence.
WordBag is a program which will read in a list of single words ordered alphabetically and outputs a list of those words with the number of occurences of those words printed to their left.

Both findWords and wordBag default to stdin as for input.

Use "$make all" to compile both findWords and wordBag.
Use "$make findWords" to compile findWords.
Use "$make wordBag" to compile wordBag.
Use "$make clean" to remove all compiled files.
